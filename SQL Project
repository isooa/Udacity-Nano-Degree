/*Let's start with creating a table that provides the following details: 
actor's first and last name combined as full_name, film title, film description and length of the movie.

How many rows are there in the table?*/

SELECT a.first_name||' '||a.last_name AS full_name, f.title, f.description, f.length
FROM 
actor a 
JOIN film_actor fa
ON a.actor_id=fa.actor_id
JOIN film f
ON f.film_id=fa.film_id


Write a query that creates a list of actors and movies where the movie length was more than 60 minutes. 
How many rows are there in this query result?

SELECT a.first_name||' '||a.last_name AS full_name, f.title
FROM 
actor a 
JOIN film_actor fa
ON a.actor_id=fa.actor_id
JOIN film f
ON f.film_id=fa.film_id
WHERE f.length > 60

Write a query that captures the actor id, full name of the actor, and counts the number of movies each actor has made.
(HINT: Think about whether you should group by actor id or the full name of the actor.) 
Identify the actor who has made the maximum number movies.


SELECT a.actor_id, a.first_name||' '||a.last_name AS full_name, COUNT(f.title)

actor a 
JOIN film_actor fa

GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 1


/*Write a query that displays a table with 4 columns: 
actor's full name, film title, length of movie, and a column name "filmlen_groups" that 
classifies movies based on their length. Filmlen_groups should include 4 categories:

Match the filmlen_groups with the movie titles in your result dataset.*/

Revise the query you wrote above to create a count of movies in each of the 4 filmlen_groups:
