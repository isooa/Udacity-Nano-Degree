The code produces the total rentals per category alongside the movies with the maximum rentals in those categories

Final conclusion for visualization 1

/* Udacity 1st project: Investigate a Relational Database */

/* Question 1:
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. 
The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
For each category, there are movies who have maximum rentals. 
Create a query to get a percentage of the total rentals for each category contributed by the rentals of the highest renting movies.

Solution: */
